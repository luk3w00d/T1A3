## User Guide

To use the Photo Metadata Manager you need to first find where the image you want to use is located.
Like this example. /Users/ComputerName/Photos/Image_Name.jpg make sure if there are any capital characters you do the same. Also check what file it is which could be jpg or png.
once you have finished loading the image you will be able to select what you would like to do with the image which includes viewing Copy-write info, Date and time, What device model used, Artist and Device make. You can afterwards select if you would like to edit that data or remove it.
